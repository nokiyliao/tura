# Router Crate Architecture

`crates/router` decides where work goes and how the worker lives. It owns CLI
forwarding, agent registration metadata, runtime-worker dispatch, and worker
lifecycle. It does not own command implementation, command alias
canonicalization, agent loop logic, or port allocation. Routing work is already
enough work.

The Cargo package and default binary name should stay compatible with Tura:

```text
package = router
default binary = tura_router
```

## Layout

```text
crates/router/
  Cargo.toml
  README.md
  ARCHITECTURE.md
  src/
    main.rs
    registry.rs
    registry/
      agent.rs
    services.rs
    services/
      managed_process.rs
      manager.rs

      rust_service.rs
      worker_process.rs
    utils/
      cli.rs
      port.rs
      process.rs
```

The current implementation is concentrated in the Axum entrypoint plus the agent
registry, service manager, and utility modules above.

## Transports: stdio child vs. detached socket daemon

The router serves the same `IpcRequest`/`IpcResponse` contract over two
transports:

- **`tura_router serve`** — stdin/stdout child owned by the gateway
  (`RouterProcess`). One JSON request per line; the gateway multiplexes
  responses back to per-call mailboxes by `request_id`.
- **`tura_router serve-socket`** — a **detached daemon**:
  binds a loopback socket, publishes `addr`, `version`, `pid`, and
  `process_start_time` to
  `<db_dir>/router.addr`, **starts and owns the single `tura_session_db`**, and
  serves every front. Fronts **probe `router.addr`, health-check the daemon, and
  reuse** it, or spawn one if no compatible healthy daemon answers. `cli`
  (thin CLI) uses this: probe-or-start, send `execution.enqueue_turn`, render
  the result from session_db.

Gateway-owned GUI/TUI launches keep a stdin lifetime lease to the gateway and
send periodic `lifecycle.front_heartbeat` leases to router. When that pipe
reaches EOF, gateway exits without killing router; router prunes the expired
gateway lease and self-shuts down after `TURA_ROUTER_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS` when
no valid gateway lease, exec socket, active runtime worker, or active turn
remains. If a CLI or runtime connection drops mid-request, the router aborts
that connection's unfinished request tasks and cancels any active
`execution.enqueue_turn` session. This prevents router-owned `command_run`
subprocesses from continuing after their caller is gone.

When a compatible `service.addr` already points to a live `tura_session_db`
(for example after a router crash where the DB owner survived), router
adopts that service instead of spawning a second owner. Session DB start,
restart, and stop operations are serialized; `execution.shutdown` marks the
service lifecycle terminal before waiting for any in-flight start, so a late
health probe cannot recreate the owner after router shutdown. `execution.shutdown`
always sends the session_db shutdown command, including for an adopted service,
then removes the router endpoint as the socket daemon exits.

Both transports handle requests **concurrently** (`tokio::spawn` per request,
shared locked writer), so a slow `execution.enqueue_turn` never head-of-line
blocks a concurrent `health_check`. Responses carry `request_id` so callers
match them regardless of completion order.

`execution.enqueue_turn` is the authority for per-session active-turn state. If
the router already has an active turn for the requested `session_id`, it returns
an application payload with `ok: false` and `code: "session_active_turn"`; the
gateway converts normal prompts in that state into `session.append_user_command`
follow-ups for the running runtime.

## Responsibilities

Router owns:

- Agent registry (agent spec resolution metadata).
- CLI forwarding rules (`/run_tool`: resolve a tool binary and forward stdio).
- Runtime-worker dispatch (`POST /run_agent`): agent resolution, worker
  environment contract assembly, and worker subprocess lifecycle.
- Router-owned `command_run` execution. Runtime workers request
  `execution.command_run` over router IPC; runtime never falls back to local
  shell execution when the router is unavailable.
- Concurrency guards for runtime workers (depth and active-worker limits).
- Worker status monitoring (`/services/status`).
- Health checks that do not depend on port allocation.

Router does not own:

- Agent loops.
- Prompt assembly.
- Provider request formatting.
- Provider credentials (owned by gateway OAuth).
- Command handler logic above the ownership boundary; command handlers execute
  in router-owned tasks and inherit router process-scope cleanup.
- Command alias canonicalization (owned by `crates/tools`).
- Shell execution ownership and process-tree cleanup.
- File locks.
- Port allocation.

## Runtime Worker Dispatch

`POST /run_agent` is the HTTP entrypoint for running an agent turn (used by the
gateway boundary). The CLI subcommand `tura_router run-agent` is the
**internal** entrypoint used by a running runtime worker that wants to spawn a
child sub-session — it reads a `RunAgentRequest` JSON from stdin and writes the
result JSON to stdout. Both entrypoints share the same core
`dispatch_run_agent(...)` implementation, so behavior is identical.

The router:

1. Resolves the agent spec from the agent registry.
2. Resolves the runtime worker binary: the standalone `tura_runtime`, then
   performs a **version handshake** — the worker's `health_check` reply carries
   `tura_path::instance_version()` and the router refuses a mismatched build.
3. Builds the worker environment contract: `TURA_ROLE`, `TURA_GATEWAY_URL`,
   `TURA_SESSION_MODEL_OVERRIDE`, `TURA_PARENT_SESSION_ID`,
   `TURA_PLANNING_DEPTH`, plus any caller-supplied session-config env
   merged from the request `worker_env`.
4. Enforces concurrency guards before dispatch: child depth must not exceed
   `MAX_PLANNING_DEPTH`, and active runtime workers must not exceed
   `MAX_RUNTIME_WORKERS`. Either breach returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
5. Enforces one running runtime per `session_id`. A second dispatch for a
   session that already has a live `runtime_worker:{session_id}` record returns
   `409 Conflict` and does not reuse, replace, or invoke the existing worker.
6. Ensures the worker is live and forwards the call over the worker NDJSON
   protocol.

Worker subprocesses are spawned through the shared process-scope helper:

- every Tokio worker command enables `kill_on_drop(true)` so cancellation,
  panic, early return, or timeout drops do not leave the direct child running;
- Windows workers are assigned to a Job Object with
  `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so router exit closes the scope and
  tears down the worker tree;
- Unix workers start in their own process group, and Linux additionally sets
  `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG=SIGTERM` before exec with a parent-pid race check;
- router stop and one-shot timeout paths terminate the scope before reaping the
  direct child, so worker-spawned subprocesses are included in cleanup.
- one-shot workers keep the active process scope in the worker owner while an
  invocation is running. `ServiceManager::stop_worker_by_key` signals the
  invocation and terminates that scope, so gateway/TUI/GUI abort does not merely
  remove router registry state while the runtime child continues running.

Persistent worker stdout is protocol-owned. Non-JSON stdout lines are treated
as worker noise, logged, and skipped before parsing the JSON response; stderr is
still redirected to the worker log path.

The worker owns its own session state and reports progress back to the gateway
through callbacks; the router does not merge agent state. Delegated terminal
callbacks are first published to the existing Session lifecycle store with the
parent mission revision, delegated-input digest, terminal receipt digest, and
exact agent-message effect identity. Socket failure leaves that same record
pending for restart replay, and the router acknowledges it only after the
Commander-facing socket write and flush complete.

## Session DB Data Path

Router starts and supervises the `session_db` service, but normal session reads
and writes are outside router IPC. Gateway and runtime helpers use their direct
session DB clients, which invoke `tura_router session-db-call`; the persistent
router process only accepts lifecycle methods such as
`session_db.lifecycle.status` and execution methods such as
`execution.enqueue_turn`.

### Internal-only CLI channel (runtime ↔ router)

When a runtime worker needs to spawn a child sub-session (concurrent or
recursive multi-agent dispatch), it invokes `tura_router run-agent` as a
**subprocess** (stdin/stdout JSON). It does **not** call the router over
HTTP/URL. This rule is enforced repo-wide:

- Internal runtime ↔ router communication is **always CLI** (subprocess +
  stdin/stdout NDJSON), never URL/HTTP.
- All runtimes are subprocesses; the router process never embeds a runtime in
  the same address space.
- The HTTP `POST /run_agent` route remains only for the external gateway
  boundary; child sub-session dispatch from a runtime never goes through it.

The runtime resolves the router binary in this order: `TURA_ROUTER_BIN` env,
`current_exe()` sibling, then repo `target/{release,debug}/tura_router`.

## Agent Registration

The agent registry (`registry/agent.rs`) resolves an agent spec from a static,
in-memory table keyed by agent name and session type. `POST /run_agent` consults
it to pick the agent that the dispatched runtime worker activates. It introduces
no database and no fixed port.

Command alias canonicalization and handler dispatch are **not** owned here. They
live in `crates/tools` (`commands::canonical_command` plus the
`crates/tools/src/commands/<command>` handlers) and run inside the runtime
worker. The router does not keep a parallel command table.

## Worker Lifecycle

Router owns the lifecycle of runtime workers through `ServiceManager`
(`services/manager.rs`) and `WorkerProcess` (`services/worker_process.rs`). A
worker is the standalone `tura_runtime` binary (`TURA_ROLE=runtime_worker`); it
speaks a line-delimited NDJSON protocol over stdio and must not require a fixed
port.

Lifecycle records include:

- service id / worker id
- executable target
- startup args and environment contract
- readiness (`health_check`) and invocation (`call`) over NDJSON
- persistent vs. one-shot mode (one-shot falls back when persistent spawn fails)
- status surfaced through `/services/status`

## CLI Forwarding

`POST /run_tool` resolves a tool binary under `target/{release,debug}` and
forwards JSON input over stdio. The owning crate or
`crates/tools/src/commands/<command>` owns behavior; the router only resolves and
forwards.

## Checks

Use:
